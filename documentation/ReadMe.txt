This project was created in collaboration by:

Suhaib Ansari, Jianpeng Li, Brian Cheung, Ellen Vandewater.



=============================================
Background:

This is a EECS 448 Group project,

The goal of this project was to create the classic "battleships" game using any platform and language we would like.

Our team decided to create the project in JavaScript.

=============================================

Documentation:

Documentation can be found in the documentation folder, it is an HTML file named index.html

=============================================

How the game works:

1. When you load up the index.html page, all of the JavaScript files included in the project will be linked up to that page.

2. To play the game, simply enter in the number of ships you would like to play with in the text box at the center of the screen and click ok.
(The number of ships chosen must be between 1-5)

3. once you have clicked on OK. you should not see that text box anymore.

4. the player can then click on the rotate HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL button to rotate the ships in the direction they would like to place them on.

5. drag and drop the ships on the board on the RIGHT, which is you, the player that's playing the game's board.

6. once you have placed all of your ships. Click start to play the game.

7. all the white dots on the boards represents slots that can be fired on. The left side of the board is your opponents board.

8. when you click once on the left board, it turns red, which indicates that it is a hit. If you click on the red dot, it turns gray, which indicates as a miss. Incase you messed up.

9. on the right side board, clicking on white dot on a ship leaves you with a hit (red). and clicking on the ocean area, leaves you with a grey(miss).

10. When your ship has been sunk, the GM will notify you through a pop up box on the browser.

11. The game ends when all of your ships has sunk, or when the opponents ship have all been sunk as they communicate that information to you verbally.

12. Follow the direction on the pop up box when the game ends to start a new game.
